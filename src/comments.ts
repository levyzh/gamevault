// comments.ts — every read and write of the `comments` table lives here,

//
// The new trick in this file is the TWO-TABLE QUERY in fetchComments:
// because comments.user_id is a foreign key pointing at profiles, Supabase
// can hand back each comment with its author's profile nested inside it —
// one round trip, no manual joining on our side.

import { supabase } from "./supabase";

// Database row → app Comment. The joined profile arrives as a nested
// `profiles` object on the row; we fold it into a tidy `author` field.
// The ?? fallbacks should never fire (the foreign key guarantees an
// author exists) — they're seatbelts, not expectations.
//
// myUserId is needed for one question only: "is MY like among these?" —
// which is what lights up the heart.

// The select string is now a THREE-table query: "*" = all comment
// columns, the profiles embed for the author, and "comment_likes(user_id)"
// = follow the foreign key pointing back at comments and bring every
// like's user_id along.
//
// Note the "!user_id" on profiles: since comment_likes points at BOTH
// comments and profiles, there are now TWO roads from a comment to
// profiles — the author (via user_id) and the likers (via the likes
// table). Supabase refuses to guess which we mean, so "!user_id" names
// the road: the profile reached through the user_id column = the author.
//
// Honest tradeoff, flagged: embedding every like scales with how liked
// a comment is — perfect at this project's size, and if a comment ever
// gathers thousands of likes, the fix is asking the database to count
// instead of fetch. A good problem to have; not one to pre-solve.
